## Purpose
The site allows the user to play a game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' (RPSLS for short) against the computer. A score system is provided for the user to see the number of user wins, computer wins, and matches that end in a draw. The game is an extension of the classic, familiar rock, paper, scissors game. Because of this, showcased hand signs and rules clarifying how the game works is also included on the website. 
## Structure
When the page is loaded, the user is presented with a window explaining the rules, using a quote from the show 'Big Bang Theory'. The user exits the modal window and arrives at the main page. The main page contains a header, a game section, a score section, and finally a rules section at the bottom. 

The wepbage's layout will change depending on the size of the screen used, making the site user-friendly and responsive whether it's run on a pc, laptop, tablet or a smartphone. 
## Design
### Color scheme
For this website, lighter, medium-bright colors were used. The header, results and rule sections contains softer background colors, while the game buttons are more brightly colored against a white background. The bright coloring brings focus to the game section, which is the most important one. 

The modal window has black text against the same clear blue background as the header. A button transitioning between white and red background contrasts to the modal window. 
### Typography
### Icons
In the game buttons, icons are used to display the hand signs next to the correct game options.
